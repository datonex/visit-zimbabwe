    <h3>What to pack</h3>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    <div class="pack-box-left box">
      <h4><i class="fas fa-tshirt"></i> comfortable clothing</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
          Generally Zimbabwe is hot. Pack lightweight clothing in light, neutral colours (but not white as it gets dirty very easily). Avoid blue or black clothing – the tsetse flies are drawn to these colors, and their bite can give you African Sleeping Sickness. It is best to have longer-sleeved tops and long pants to protect from mosquitos and the sun. it is illegal to have army/combat type clothing or print. Include a warm jacket or fleece in your suitcase for evening game drives as well as a pair of comfortable walking shoes.

      <hr>
      <p>
          A wide-brimmed safari hat is really useful at any time of year, as even the winter sun is hot. Wear plenty of sunscreen and insect/mosquito repellent and moisturiser, as well as sunglasses

      <p>
          Sometimes you will be Wondering in areas where water isn't readily available. We advice you pack a few pocket sized hand sanitiser that will be easy to carry. Bring a box of face masks or bring a scarf to cover your nose and mouth

    <div class="pack-box-right box">
      <h4><i class="fas fa-medkit"></i> First aid kit</h4>
      <p>
          Buy some basic medical items such as plasters, ibuprofen, paracetamol, Immodium, tweezers, after-sun cream, cream to relieve insect bites and stings, antiseptic cream, any eyecare essentials, etc, and pack these in your luggage. If you’re prone to hay fever, remember to bring antihistamines, too. Make sure you have enough prescribed medication to last the duration of your holiday, as local pharmacies may not be able to provide certain drugs without prior arrangement.

            It is highly advisable to have travel insurance that covers medical emergencies. Carry copies of your medical insurance in your car and handbag.
